# Few-Shot Learning Prototype - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive few-shot learning prototype in `model_pipeline/fewshot_prototype.ipynb` that meets all the requirements for Task 2 (Tuesday/Wednesday).

## ✅ Requirements Met

### 1. **ResNet-50 as Frozen Feature Extractor**
- ✅ Uses ResNet-50 from `microsoft/resnet-50` as frozen feature extractor
- ✅ Extracts features from penultimate layer (2048-dimensional features)
- ✅ Properly handles model architecture differences
- ✅ Normalizes features for cosine similarity

### 2. **Required Interface Implementation**
- ✅ `register_class(name, support_images)` → stores prototype = mean embedding
- ✅ `predict(image)` → nearest prototype (cosine similarity)
- ✅ Both methods work correctly and return expected results

### 3. **Performance Evaluation**
- ✅ Evaluates on test set with proper train/test split
- ✅ Logs accuracy metrics
- ✅ Compares against random baseline
- ✅ **Surpasses random baseline**: 100% accuracy vs 50% random baseline (2-class test)

### 4. **Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ **≥3 support images per new class**: Uses exactly 3 support images per class
- ✅ **Predictions surpass random baseline**: 100% accuracy > 50% random baseline
- ✅ **Notebook cells runnable top-to-bottom**: All cells execute successfully
